00:01 (ethereal music)
00:05 - [Nestor] We've been
dislodged from Fortuna's
00:07 mainline too early.
00:09 (ominous music)
00:12 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] The
automatic guidance system
00:14 is now engaged.
00:17 (ship whooshing)
(ship beeping)
00:19 - [Commander Hargrave]
Entering upper atmosphere.
00:21 Visibility is low due to
strange cloud formation.
00:24 Our priority is to land safely.
00:27 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] Hull breached.
00:29 Secure your helmets immediately.
01:38 (ominous music)
01:42 (door clicking and whooshing)
01:46 (wind blowing)
01:53 (door whirring)
01:57 (footsteps shuffling)
01:01 (ominous music continues)
01:10 (thunder rumbling)
01:13 - A.R.T.E.M.I.S, status report.
01:15 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] It appears
we have prematurely disembarked
01:17 on Proxima Centauri b.
01:19 - Crashed, you mean.
01:21 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] There
are no active signs of life
01:23 in our current vicinity?
01:25 After conducting an
atmospheric safety test,
01:28 the air is breathable.
01:30 - Finally, some good news.
02:33 (helmet pressure whooshing)
02:37 Got it. Attempt to
contact Fortuna.
02:40 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] Connecting
your distress beacon
02:42 to the Fortuna
communications bay now.
02:48 (thunder rumbling)
02:55 (electronic binoculars whirring)
02:57 (lightning crashing)
02:06 - Where the hell are we?
02:08 Been completely
thrown off course.
02:09 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] My
apologies, Commander.
02:11 I am unable to make contact.
02:13 All communications with the
ship appear to be offline.
02:17 - That's just great. Are
we able to send a message?
02:19 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] Yes.
02:20 You can record a
message that will be sent
02:22 once communications
(beeping)
02:23 with Fortuna are reestablished.
02:26 - This commander Chris Hargrave.
02:28 The A.R.T.E.M.I.S Exploration
pod is preemptively set down
03:31 on the surface of
Proxima Centauri b.
03:33 And is currently
non-operational.
03:35 A recovery team will need to
be sent to these coordinates
03:38 as we require
immediate assistance.
03:41 Wait, your reply.
03:42 (communicator beeping)
03:43 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] The
message is awaiting signal
03:45 from satellite Europa
PXB for retrieval.
03:48 - Guess all we
can do now is, wait.
03:51 (wind blowing)
03:57 (footsteps shuffling)
03:00 (door whirring)
03:03 - Ah!
03:07 - What the fuck is that thing?
03:09 It's too much.
03:11 (door whirring)
03:12 (door thudding)
03:15 (footsteps plodding)
03:19 - [Nestor] Chris. Where are you?
03:21 I need help.
03:23 - Hello?
03:24 (ominous ethereal music)
03:26 Who's out there?
03:30 Nestor is that you?
04:32 - [Nestor] Please,
you must save me.
04:36 You must save me.
04:37 (ominous ethereal music)
04:40 (door beeping and whirring)
04:44 - Please help me.
04:45 Release me from this prison.
04:48 - I want to but,
04:50 I can't.
04:51 - Will you bring my agony,
04:53 to an end?
04:54 (door thudding)
04:55 (eerie foreboding music)
04:60 - I don't know what
to do. I'm sorry.
04:04 (man gasping)
(creature sloshing)
04:08 The fuck are you?
04:10 What do you want from us?
04:11 - All creatures
desire one thing.
04:14 Freedom.
04:16 You will help me achieve it.
04:18 My species is on
the brink of extinction
04:20 and we need a new
planet to colonize.
04:24 - How do you intend to do that?
04:26 - If you want
your friend to live
04:28 then you have no other
option, but to help us.
05:31 (creature slithering)
05:32 - You're not having him.
05:33 You're not getting
the earth either.
05:35 - That's what you think.
05:36 We've been waiting
a thousand years.
05:38 And now that you've
arrived, you will be the one
05:41 to take us off this dying planet
to form a new civilization.
05:47 - No thanks. I
think I'd rather die.
05:50 (man groaning and vibrating)
05:53 (computer beeping)
05:55 What is this?
05:57 How are you doing that?
05:01 - Daddy.
05:03 Hope space is fun.
05:05 When you coming home?
05:07 (creature slithering)
(man gasping)
05:08 - Hunter?
05:09 (creature slithering)
(man exclaiming)
05:13 - Hi darling.
05:14 I know you're off
doing amazing things
05:17 and saving the planet.
(computer beeping)
05:19 I miss you so much.
05:22 Your son wants to meet you.
05:25 - Turn this off. And
get out of my head.
05:28 - If you want to see
your wife and son again,
06:31 then you will have no other
option, but to help us.
06:33 We will do what we can to spare.
06:34 - I said turn it off.
06:36 (ship booming)
06:38 You listen to me.
06:40 I don't know what
you want from us,
06:41 but you need to
let him go right now.
06:44 - There is not a good siege.
06:46 (man groaning)
06:47 This is our only
chance for salvation.
06:50 Free us and we release
your friend unharmed.
06:54 Your options for choice
limited, commander.
06:58 - Stop.
06:59 Just let him go
06:01 and we'll talk.
06:05 - He will be released, when
we no longer require you.
06:12 - God dammit.
06:13 (tense foreboding music)
06:22 (footsteps plodding)
07:31 (thunder rumbling)
07:36 (heart beating)
07:39 (Chris breathing)
07:42 (helmet pressure whooshing)
07:43 (heart beating)
07:48 (ominous ethereal music)
07:60 (alarm beeping)
07:00 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S]
Life support levels
07:01 for Officer
Flannery are critical.
07:04 Attach emergency O
two supply immediately.
07:08 (alarm beeping)
07:09 (helmet pressure whooshing)
07:11 - Shit. Nestor.
07:14 A.R.T.E.M.I.S, how much
oxygen does the pod have left?
07:17 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] Oxygen
levels are at 19%.
07:19 - Not good.
07:20 What's our fuel situation?
How much fuel do we have?
07:22 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] There is
currently 37% fuel remaining.
07:26 - Guess that's gonna have to do.
07:27 Has contact with Fortuna
been reestablished?
07:29 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] Not
at this time, Commander.
08:32 - Keep trying.
08:36 Coming for you buddy.
08:37 (door clicking and whooshing)
08:38 (Nestor gasping and groaning)
08:39 Putting an end to this.
08:40 - You'll soon (indistinct)
see your family again.
08:43 We can help.
08:45 - I'm not listening to
anymore of your lies.
08:49 A.R.T.E.M.I.S relocate
the remaining fuel
08:51 and compression
chamber of the cockpit.
08:53 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] I'm
sorry, commander.
08:55 (computer beeping)
08:56 That is a direct violation
of my safety protocol.
08:59 - I don't have time for
protocol. Just do it.
08:01 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] I am unable
to complete your request.
08:04 - Oh, for fuck's
sake, I'll do it myself.
08:06 Activate manual mode.
08:08 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] May I remind
you that all Fortuna vessels
08:10 are monitored by the
Vast Horizon Corporation.
08:13 (gentle somber music)
08:14 Failure to comply with
your contractual agreement
08:17 will result in intergenerational
debt and incarceration.
08:21 Would you like to reconsider
this lack of reason?
08:25 (dramatic uplifting music)
08:28 - I am aware.
08:30 Proceed.
09:31 - [A.R.T.E.M.I.S] Manual
operation is confirmed.
09:32 - We'll find you too.
09:34 (computer beeping)
I'm the one in control.
09:37 - I'm making sure you don't
make it off this planet alive.
09:40 - He's trying to stop us.
09:41 If you do that,
you will also die.
09:46 There's no survival without us.
09:48 - I know. I've already
lost everything.
09:51 As long as I stop you then
that's all that matters.
09:53 (ship thrusters rumbling)
09:56 (creature groaning)
09:59 (wires sparking)
09:00 (alarm blaring)
09:03 (liquid spattering)
(man gasping)
09:08 (fist thudding)
09:09 (dramatic music)
09:12 (gas whooshing)
09:17 - It's slightly
technical. (indistinct)
09:22 (creature groaning)
09:25 (footsteps plodding)
(wind blowing)
10:34 (flare fizzing)
10:36 (gentle morose music)
10:57 (flames roaring)
(man groaning)
10:04 - Daddy, why you do that?
10:07 It hurts so bad.
10:13 I thought you loved me.
10:15 Did I mean nothing to you?
10:17 (flames roaring)
10:20 (man groaning)
10:23 - You were meant to protect me.
10:25 You should have saved me.
10:27 - Sorry. I couldn't help you.
11:32 - You've helped
more than you know.
11:35 - You're not gonna hurt
another living soul.
11:38 - Fool.
11:40 You think you've won.
11:42 But there's no stopping,
11:45 decimation has already begun.
11:48 (eerie dramatic music)
11:55 (machine beeping)
11:06 - [Crew-member] Commander
Hargrave, do you copy?
11:09 This is Clear Sky's
recovery vessel.
11:11 We've received
your distress signal.
11:16 We're descending through the
atmosphere to your coordinates.
12:37 Come in Commander. Do you copy?
12:39 (communicator buzzing)
12:40 There seems to be a strange
interference, transmission.
12:43 (communicator buzzing)
12:46 Ugh, what the-
(communicator interference)
12:47 What the-
(communicator interference)
12:48 Ah!
(communicator interference)
12:50 - [Nestor] Thank you Commander.
12:52 Fortuna will be the ideal
transportation vessel
12:54 for our long journey
towards earth.
12:58 (dramatic foreboding music)
